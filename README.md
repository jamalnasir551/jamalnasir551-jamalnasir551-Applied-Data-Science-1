This dataset provides historical information about the modern Olympic Games, covering all the Games from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016. The data was collected from www.sports-reference.com in May 2018 and includes details on individual athletes participating in Olympic events.

The dataset consists of 271,116 rows and 17 columns, each representing an athlete's participation in a specific Olympic event. Here's a breakdown of the columns:


**ID:** A unique identifier for each athlete.<br>
**Name:** The full name of the athlete.<br>
**Sex:** Gender of the athlete (M for male, F for female).<br>

It's important to note that up to 1992, both Winter and Summer Games were held in the same year.

This dataset provides a valuable resource for analyzing the history of Olympic events and athlete performances.
